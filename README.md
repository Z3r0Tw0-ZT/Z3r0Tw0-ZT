## Short Introduction
I am an `Otaku` with an insatiable curiosity for the digital realm, armed with lines of code and a determination that knows no bounds, they navigate through the virtual labyrinth, constantly seeking to understand the vulnerabilities that lie beneath the surface. With a cup of coffee in one hand and a keyboard under the other, I learn development frameworks and hacking tools.
